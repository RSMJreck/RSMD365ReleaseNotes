# Release Notes for 10.0.6.201911
## AFI 10.0.201911
### - Initial pullback
- <div>This accelerator will facilitate the extraction, auditing and automatic creation of payment invoices using standards of the banking industry. This platform uses metadata to help interpret flat and hierarchical text documents sent by banks and containing customer payment information. The records so interpreted will be presented in a workbench for auditing, manual update and eventual automatic generation of payment invoices to settle customer pending invoices. The use of metadata allow for the interpretation of different types of formats; currently Lockbox and ACH have been successfully tested.</div>
