# Release Notes for 10.0.6.201911
## PSS 10.0.201911
### - Service import
- <div>The service import feature, can be used to import services directly from the ProShip service instead of requiring the ProShip xml configuration file from the ProShip installation. This simplifies the process for the ProShip service setup.<br></div>
### - Payload reviewing for sent/received ProShip XML
- <div>This functionality will enable users to obtain request and response XML files from communication exchanges between customers and the ProShip service. These instruments can be analyzed to derive reasons for unwanted behaviors or results.<br></div>
### - Return Service assignment
- <div>This new functionality can be used when a potential return is expected; in such case, after identifying and indicating what shipping service should be used for returns, after the shipping label and other documents are printed as usual, another call to the ProShip service is made and a new return label is printed that can then be used in the shipping process.</div>
